## Notes

**Program Verification Methodology:** All programs listed were verified by fetching their official catalog pages and confirming that the program descriptions explicitly contain terms related to Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Science, Statistics, Data Analytics, Data Visualization, Data Modeling, or closely related computational/analytical fields.

**Additional Observations:** 
- The STATMS program (Statistics MS with PhD option) is no longer accepting applications and has been replaced by the Statistics and Data Science MS program (STATDSMS)
- Several programs explicitly mention machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science components in their curricula
- The Computer Science and related programs span multiple colleges including College of Science, College of Engineering, College of Information Science, and Graduate College
